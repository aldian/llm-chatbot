# llm-chatbot

As I am using the GitHub Free plan, the largest file I store can only have size 2GB.
When I try to store the LLM model in this repo, I got this error:
```
Size must be less than or equal to 2147483648: [422] Size must be less than or equal to 2147483648
```
Please provide the LLM model yourself, or you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cvIeDSwH1IzN7ouvwmb1vgg6UTcJIBdq?usp=drive_link).
After checking out this repo, create a folder named `llm_models`, and copy/move the LLM models to it.
